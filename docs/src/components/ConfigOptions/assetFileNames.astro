    ### `assetFileNames`
  
    **Type:** `string`
  
    **Default:** `_astro/[name]@[width].[hash][extname]`
  
    The file name pattern for the image assets generated. This config can be used as an alternative to `vite.build.rollupOptions.output.assetFileNames` so that the pattern only applies to assets generated by `astro-imagetools`. Patterns support the following placeholders:

    - `[name]` - the name of the asset (basename of the source file unless the source was a data URI, in which case it's the hash of the data)
    - `[width]` - the width descriptor of the image asset
    - `[hash]` - the hash of the asset path. A specific length can be specified by appending a colon and the desired length, e.g. `[hash:8]`
    - `[ext]` - the extension of the asset (without the leading `.`)
    - `[extname]` - the extension of the asset (with the leading `.`)

    > **Note:** Currently, the hash is generated from the asset path, not the asset content. This means that if you change the asset content, the hash will not change. It will be fixed in a future release.
